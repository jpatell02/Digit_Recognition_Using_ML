Digit recognition is a subfield of machine learning and computer vision that focuses on identifying and classifying numerical digits from images. This technology is widely used in various applications, such as optical character recognition (OCR), automated postal sorting, and form processing.

Key Concepts
Image Preprocessing: Before recognizing digits, images are often preprocessed to improve accuracy. This can involve techniques like resizing, normalization, and noise reduction.

Feature Extraction: Important features from the images, such as edges and shapes, are extracted to help differentiate between digits.

Machine Learning Models: Common models for digit recognition include:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These are particularly effective for image data, as they can learn hierarchical features.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): These can also be used for classification but may require more manual feature engineering.
Datasets: The MNIST dataset is one of the most well-known benchmarks for digit recognition, containing thousands of labeled handwritten digits.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used metrics to assess the performance of digit recognition models.
